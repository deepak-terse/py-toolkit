# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) using Langchain

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Langchain, a powerful framework for building LLM applications. RAG enhances language models by combining retrieval-based and generation-based approaches, allowing for more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Overview

RAG works by:
1. Retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base
2. Augmenting the input prompt with the retrieved context
3. Generating responses using a language model

## Features

- Document ingestion and processing
- Vector storage for efficient retrieval
- Context-aware response generation
- Integration with Langchain's powerful tools and utilities
